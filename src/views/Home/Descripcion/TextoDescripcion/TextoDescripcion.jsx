  I am a Programming Analyst and Fullstack JavaScript Developer with a strong foundation in education. 
  Before transitioning into tech, I spent seven years teaching English as a Foreign Language (EFL), earning a Master of Arts in TESOL and achieving a C2-level certification under the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). 
  This background has deeply shaped my ability to break down complex ideas into clear, accessible explanations —a skill that translates seamlessly into both software development and developer-focused communication. 
  <br /><br />
  I thrive on learning and using technology to solve real-world problems. I build responsive and user-centered web applications using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. 
  I have hands-on experience working with REST APIs, manipulating the DOM, and managing version control with Git and GitHub. I develop with React (including this very portfolio!), work with relational databases using PostgreSQL, and I am currently strengthening my backend skills with Node.js and Express. 
  <br /><br />
  Beyond traditional web development, I explore innovative technologies within the JavaScript ecosystem. My recent projects include interactive applications using Phaser 3 for game development, ml5.js for client-side machine learning, and the Web Speech API for voice recognition and synthesis.
  I am particularly passionate about accessibility and inclusive design —I build tools that empower users, such as communication apps for non-verbal individuals and voice-driven navigation systems for people with visual, cognitive, or literacy challenges.
  <br /><br />
  My mission is to bridge technology and human experience. Whether through web development, educational technology, or creative coding, I aim to create meaningful digital solutions that reach and benefit diverse users.
