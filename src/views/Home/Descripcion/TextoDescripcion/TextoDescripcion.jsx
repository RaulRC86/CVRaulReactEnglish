          I am a programming analyst and a student of the JavaScript Fullstack
          Development Bootcamp at Desafío Latam. With a background in education,
          I have spent the past seven years teaching English as a Foreign
          Language (EFL), earning a Master of Arts in TESOL, and achieving a
          C2-level certification in the CEFR. My experience in education has
          shaped my ability to break down complex concepts into simple,
          understandable terms—an invaluable skill in both teaching and software
          development. <br />
          <br />
          I thrive on learning and applying technology to solve real-world
          problems. Currently, I build responsive and effective web applications
          using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I have experience working with REST
          APIs, manipulating the DOM, and managing version control with Git and
          GitHub. I also develop with React (including this very portfolio!),
          work with relational databases using PostgreSQL, and I am currently expanding my
          backend skills with NodeJS and Express. <br />
          <br />
          Beyond traditional web development, I enjoy exploring innovative
          technologies within the JavaScript ecosystem. My projects include
          interactive applications built with Phaser3 for game development,
          ml5.js for machine learning, and the Web Speech API for voice
          recognition and synthesis. I am passionate about continuous learning
          and mastering diverse technologies to contribute meaningfully to the
          industry, whether through web development, education technology, or
          creative applications of programming focused on promoting a positive and meaningful experience to all types of users.
